# Music-Chairs
Simulation of the famous game music chairs. Someone hits a drum random times (1-10). After the music stops, one player loses and we remove a chair. There are N players. After N-1 rounds we have a winner. Contains makefile. Use `make` to compile, `make run` to run the program and `make clean` to remove object files and executable. Written in C++, Ubuntu 16.04.3 LTS
