# Music-Chairs
Simulation of the famous game music chairs (writen in C++, Ubuntu 16.04.3 LTS). Someone hits a drum random 1-10 times. After the music stops, one player loses and we remove a chair. There are N players. After N-1 rounds we have a winner. Contains makefile. Use make to compile, make run to run the program and make clean to remove object files and executable.
